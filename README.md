## Project structure

**The project is organized as follows:**
- `docs/`: Contains project documentation, instructions, and explanations.
- `src/`: Contains the source code files implementing the core functionality of the Game of Life simulation.
- `include/`: Contains header files declaring classes and functions used throughout the project.
- `test/`: Contains unit tests and test cases to verify the correctness of the implementation.
- `input/`: Contains files used to initialize the grid (e.g., test patterns).
- `output/`: Contains files generated by the program (e.g., final grid states).
- `external/`: Contains submodules such as Google Test and any other third-party dependencies.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: The CMake configuration file used to build the project and manage dependencies.

## Build and Run (macOS or Linux)

To build and run the project on macOS or Linux, please follow these steps in your terminal:

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2. Initialize and update the Google Test submodule:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

3. Create a build directory:
```
mkdir build
```

4. Navigate into build directory:
```
cd build
```

5. Generate the build files using CMake:
```
cmake ..
```

6. Build the project:
```
cmake --build .
```

7. Run the main program (replace `GameOfLife` with the actual executable name if different):
```
./GameOfLife
```

8. To run the game_tests (assuming the tests executable is named `game_tests`):
```
./game_tests
```

These instructions assume the project is configured to include Google Test as a submodule and that CMakeLists.txt is properly set up to build both the main application and the tests.
